Linked List:-
1. Elements are store in nodes that r linked together using pointer.

		|  56 | add of next node (1005)| --------->		|106| 
		data	address	(8745)					(1005)   


first node -> head node
last node -> tail node

Pointer In Java:-
there is pointer in Java

1.Implicit pointers 
2. No explicit pointer in Java

call by value:
int x = 45 
int y = x
int y = 85 

x= 45, y = 85


Node is a datatype
next has address such as x202044 
data is a type of integer
head is pointing to the address of the node
at first (when node = 0) then the next is null and head is also null  



opertaions:-
1. Insert operations.
-> At the end 

	There are many nodes
	take head to the last node by traversing
	take temp as ref of head
	traverse till temp.next!= null
	temp = temp.next
	when you reach at last (temp.next = null)
	temp = address of the last node
	then:-
		temp.next = newNode;
		



-> At the beginning 

	create the node with the data;
	Node n = new Node(data);
	check if any node exists or not
	if no node exisits (means head == null) then
		make that node as the first node and 
		make it's next as null;
		head must be pointed to the addrss of that node
	else:-
		head is pointing to address of the first node.
		make new node's address = head
		then head = newNode

-> At a particular position

	given the position
	if it's pos=0 (first position)
		newNode.next = head;
		head =  newNode 
	else:-
	take temp = head;
	traverse
